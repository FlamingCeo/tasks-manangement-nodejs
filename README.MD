# Node.js CRUD Tasks Management

This GitHub repository showcases my skills in Node.js by implementing a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) tasks management system. The project provides a simple yet effective solution for managing tasks, allowing users to perform essential operations on a collection of tasks.

## Features

- **Create**: Users can create new tasks by providing relevant details such as task name, description, due date, and priority.
- **Read**: The system enables users to view the existing tasks, including their details and current status.
- **Update**: Users have the ability to modify task information such as the name, description, due date, or priority. This feature facilitates task management and keeps the system up to date.
- **Delete**: Tasks that are no longer relevant or completed can be easily deleted from the system, maintaining a clean and organized task list.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A powerful JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side development.
- **Express.js**: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, facilitating the creation of robust APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A popular NoSQL database used for storing task-related information.
- **Mongoose**: An elegant object modeling tool for Node.js, providing a straightforward way to interact with MongoDB.
- **RESTful API**: The project follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) to design a scalable and easily consumable API.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: The frontend user interface is built using these standard web technologies, providing an intuitive and interactive user experience.
